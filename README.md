# Hi, hello!👋 
**I'm Marissa Maldonado: former mathematics major, current student of life.**

<details>
<summary>Introducing myself, TDF goals, future plans, research, curiosities, and personal strengths!</summary>

After 6 years of studying math (with a bit of computer science here and there), I came to realize I wanted experience with real-world projects. I knew that learning was more than being lectured to and regurgitating notes on an exam, so I built projects across web design, STEM education research, and community engagement workshops in my free time. I'm looking forward to getting out of my comfort zone in TDF and finally exploring applications beyond the textbook. 

**TDF Goals:**
- Get used to getting my hands dirty! My former degree led me to being a perfectionist, but that may not be possible in this program.
- Start with the most intimidating project first! I want to become comfortable exploring new software and machinery offered through MDes.
- Make something quirky every week! I used to toil over math homework to make time for creativity, and now my entire program revolves around it -- it's a privilege!

**Foresight:** Earning my PhD in Educational Technologies and either teaching at a university or moving into industry as a researcher!📚

**Research topics:** Adult Education, Curriculum Design, Educational Technologies, Currere (connection between subject and self)

**Curiosities:**
- Answering the question of the modern student: *when will I use this in the real world?*
- Exploring emerging technologies and digital media tools that could be integrated into classrooms
- Figuring out how students/learners can express their identity in their education
- Building learning environments that foster creativity while still meeting educational objectives
- Improving online documentation for self expression and knowledge-sharing

**Strengths:**
- Lists are my jam. I am a procedural person and like to zoom out and see the bigger picture of a project.
- I *love* documentation! Despite my math degree never truly requiring writing assignments, I enjoyed reflecting on my courses and thinking about abstract ways that my lectures connected to my passions in design.
- I'm a strong advocate of professional development tools/frameworks. As a Native American woman in STEM, having mentorship to formally express my passions helped me reach my goals -- and now I want to build those tools for others' self-actualization as well.
