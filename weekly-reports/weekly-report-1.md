# Weekly Report 1: 08/24 - 8/31

I must inform you, with my PhD goals lingering in the back of my head -- wondering what a *truly engaging* learning environment looks like for adult students -- I am often viewing my educational experience through two lenses as both a student and future educator. I think MDes is the perfect case study for looking at a brand new program, seeing what it means to give students autonomy and flexibility in their curriculum, and to challenge the status quo of common andragogical standards at a renowned research institution. What tools are we using, how were they introduced to us, what feedback have I heard from peers, how extensive is documentation for the course, do students *use* that documentation, etc... **This goal may prove to be exhausting, but I want to build my tolerance for discomfort early on if I want to write a dissertation, so here I go.** 📚💪

Considering my background is in STEM education: yes, the syllabus is my holy grail. I love the first day of class because we get to go over course expectations and curriculum! There are also motivational breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout the seminar. Here are some of my notes from our lecture on 8/24.

>Transcribing hand-written notes (although I love analog) will not be conducive to contributing towards our personal AI model at the end of the semester. I'll be transitioning to my macbook because time is of the essence. I'll make sure to still experiment with physical sketching/ideation methods and submit them here though.📝

- We're here to build competencies in emerging technologies.
- There's no guidebook with emerging technologies, be a fast learner.
- Reflection is valuable and there are many mediums available to document ideas.
  - A concept I never considered: **documentation contributes to preserving intellectual property** (wow!).
  - The world is our oyster: decisions, calculations, designs, ideas, research, inspiration, changes, modifications, iterations, reflections, sketches, diagrams, schematics, images, video, GIFs, Figma, web links, and more!
  - This means: WRITE! We are here to develop our voices in design.
- An instructional method I've never seen before: offering difficulty levels for projects.
  - This ties back to student autonomy and letting them determine how intense they structure their semester.
- This class trains us to cultivate a prototyping mindset and take risks! I am honestly not used to this, I used to write math proofs that were due twice a month and I had weeks at a time to perfect them. I recognize now that there was a level of complacency I grew accustomed to in my math courses over the years, but now it's time to be curious and nervous and feel all of the feelings!

## Project 1: Computational Design
The initial onboarding for the class did feel a bit overwhelming, but I expected that and it is probably the natural reaction towards the transition into graduate school. Once I got everything set up with my Wiki page I felt better prepared to start the journey of documenting my progress.

We were introduced to a sample problem: constructing a phone stand. My mind immediately went to this thought: how can I use this for my YouTube videos and Instagram reels? I felt guilty at first when wanting to meet my own needs, but I suppose I am also an end-user for products? 

From there, I tried to switch gears and consider a more general population of users beyond myself: Gen Z content creators. Something that both they and I have in common is needing a product that supports multiple formats for holding a phone. Different social platforms require different parameters.

- YouTube
  - Video format is typically horizontal orientation for long-form videos
  - Still shots (AKA b-roll) for transitions
- Instagram reels/YouTube Shorts/TikTok
  - Video format is typically vertical orientation for short-form videos
  - Often recording at different angles, need to be able to hold the phone in place without it slipping
  - Users are often on-the-go and can't afford something clunky -- especially for younger generations, it may even be *embarassing* to look like they're doing anything that isn't nonchalant
 
This list led me to thinking, what would hold the phone in place? From what I have available at home, I'd just slap a rubber band around the phone + stand and call it good, but that's not manageable for a user since it would be in the way of the screen. So some sort of clasp that holds onto the edges without intersecting the lock/volume buttons?

**Now let's consider accessibility!**
One of the lecturers mentioned how although there are a lot of online resources available for learning emerging technologies, they may have implicit biases that we then inherit. So in terms of the phone stand prototype, are we, as designers, assuming...

- User environment
- Physical attributes (height, range of motion, accessibility features)
- Cultural background
- Product experience and social cues

The provided visuals for the slides were informative too. The 3-dimensional plotted graph that tracked range of motion for a user really caught my eye. There are geometric capabilities beyond free range sketching during the ideation process. There are computational tools that can contribute to the design as well (all of my years in math and I finally get to see a technology application!)

There was a great anecdote mentioned as well. Architects know they're going to create a building, but we, as designers, cannot guarantee the tangible form of a design process like they can. Our job title does not promise an outcome, our actions do.

**Now for the scary part: Rhino + Grasshopper.** It only feels intimidating because I've never worked in a CAD software before, but I'm going to make sure to explore some general Rhino tutorials to at least feel comfortable navigating the program. The next step is checking out the prototype documents that were shared with us and tinkering with them. 

Hindsight as I prepare for this step: I want to do more than just print the original design. I don't have the skills to build something from scratch in Rhino, but I *really* want to try out Grasshopper because messing with parameters that automatically update the design seems more manageable. I also recognize that as I prepare for my own prototype, I keep thinking about my lacking skillsets in CAD software to 3D print and lack of know-how for Adobe Illustrator to laser cut.😓 This makes me want to shy away from building my own design, but I must conquer the anxiety in order to try out cool ideas!
