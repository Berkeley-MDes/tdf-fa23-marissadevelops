# Weekly Report 5: 9/28 - 10/4

## Thursday Lecture Reflection 9/28📚

The process of information overload when being presented all of the proposed ideas for Project 2 was unique, but I feel I was very naive in my approach. My sense of curiosity overpowered my considerations for feasability. And although I proposed the Health of Graduate Students idea, I did not end up being assigned it -- which is fine, because I realize now I may have been very defensive over the process since it was my brainchild. 

Instead, I am working in the Robotics Wire Sculpting group. I was so focused on the notion of building a digital ecosystem to create art installations that I never once considered feasability when voting for the project! It is scary to begin interacting with all of the required components across motors, robotics, microcontrollers, and sensors, but I knew that if I were in my Graduate Student Health project, that would've been well within my comfort zone. I am always obsessed with my niche topic from an educator lens, but sometimes I want to step away and just be a student in STEM. I believe that from experiencing the highs and lows of prototyping, it may actually teach me *more* about the learning experience of students than if I simply view it from a meta perspective.

When I got together with my group (Matthew, Stephanie, Divya, Yoojin, Yanru), we were all generally nervous to actualzie this idea, besides Matthew, who proposed the idea in the first place! 

## Some immediate challenges:

- There is already a wire bender in the makerspace, *but* it has limited mobility and user interaction (ie, "Oh no, did we just sign up to re-invent the wheel?")
- Only one of us had coding experience, one had mechanical engineering experience, and the rest of us were mainly digital designers.
- Six people is a lot, and we'd have to break up into groups eventually, but we needed to figure out where to atleast start first.
- Our ideation process kept coming back to focusing on a single artifact to be wire wrapped, instead of building a digital ecosystem regardless of the artifact.

We all decided to ferment on the idea over the weekend and search for inpsiration. Some people wanted to completely stray away from the initial concept and do an entirely different project (with less workload), but eventually we all still committed to the idea after having a group meeting. 

## The Group Meeting:

The ideation was all over the place (in a good way)! We began reflecting on orientation of the wire feeder, how sensors could be used to sculpt wire, the possibility of sculpting other materials, and the item we'd use to apply pressure to the wire itself (to mold it).

**Ideas:**

Goal: Approachable installation using sensors that alters the angle at which wire exits a wire feeder, leading to a wire sculpture. 

Robotic wire sculpting ideation:

- Motivation:
  - crystal wire wrapping: having a sculpting model that could wrap any object the user inserts into the space
  - 2D wire sculpting: Application: consider an etch-a-sketch that alters x-y aspects
- Sensors:
  - using values from sensors (distance of user from sensor) to determine x-y-curvature coordinates
- Possible formats:
  - Etch-a-sketch inspiration: grid of pins, tying string to magnet on top, back has magnet that is controlled similarly; user interactions with sensors alter design that is constructed
  - 3D pen, plastic-based (PLA)?
  - Wire feeder with interactive robotic arm to guide shape of wire ⭐
- Orienting angle of wire to guide curves:
  - Tube-like structure (macaroni noodle shaped)
  - Wedge-like structure (small linear arm)

Splitting into two groups:

- One team
  - Half focus on sensors and digital mechanisms
  - Half focus on robotics mechanisms
  - *Would have issues with working asynchronously with physical/digital*
- Two teams ⭐
  - Creation (interactive mechanism to build the structure): Matthew, Marissa, Divya
  - Destruction (interactive mechanism to destroy the structure): Stephanie, Yanru, Yoojin
  - *Don’t have to do the same idea, but can coordinate in the future about our contrasting projects*

We landed on doing two teams that could approach the same project from two different perspectives. Although we're workign seperately, we'd like to see how they could have a symbiotic relationship when we reach a point of tangible prototypes!

# Monday Lecture Reflection 10/2📚

# Reflections

📌 If we are asked to propose project ideas, and we vote on what we're interested in, we will absolutely have to bring that idea to fruition. Tread lightly.
