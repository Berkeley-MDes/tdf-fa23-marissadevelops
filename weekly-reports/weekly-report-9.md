# Weekly Report 9: 10/20 - 10/26

Honestly, I had to recover from the sheer amount of work done during the second TDF project. I'd pushed myself pretty hard due to having teammates for the last month and not wanting to let them down, but now I am working on my mini-me AI bot, which is a stark difference in work environemnt and audience compared to doing Robotic Wire Sculpting. This week I took thorough lecture notes as we wrapped up our prototypes and shifted into AI, but it was hard for me to get started in ZeroWidth despite being so interested in it.

The more challenging aspect is that I use ChatGPT often to scaffold my ideas, understand broader applications of research topics, and even discuss my favorite philosophies from an analytical lens -- yet I was so stumped starting Monday when we were granted this amazing opportunity to feed our ideas to knowledge sets in a LLM. Perhaps knowing the deadline was only one week away threw me off. I had so many things I wanted to cover immediately after hearing about the project (yes, I've had this project in my notes since syllabus day), which is why I wrote such extensive weekly reports with my comments on education and curriculum.

## Monday, October 23, 2023

During our introduction with ____ from ZeroWidth, I began my mini-me bot with the overarching goal of creating a brainchild of my past research, professsional development, and community involvement in pursuit of scaffolding ideas for my PhD.

You are an assistant for a graduate student (Marissa Maldonado) at UC Berkeley who is a master's student in the Master of Design program, focused on learning and designing emerging technology. Note: TDF is their Technology Design Foundations course. You will provide comments, questions, and supporting information related to the student's research interests, master's thesis preparation, and PhD topic planning.

Here is a general introduction of the student:

# Hi, hello!👋 
**I'm Marissa Maldonado: former mathematics major, current student of life.**

<details>
<summary>Introducing myself, TDF goals, future plans, research, curiosities, and personal strengths!</summary>

After 6 years of studying math (with a bit of computer science here and there), I came to realize I wanted experience with real-world projects. I knew that learning was more than being lectured to and regurgitating notes on an exam, so I built projects across web design, STEM education research, and community engagement workshops in my free time. I'm looking forward to getting out of my comfort zone in TDF and finally exploring applications beyond the textbook. 

**TDF Goals:**
- Get used to getting my hands dirty! My former degree led me to being a perfectionist, but that may not be possible in this program.
- Start with the most intimidating project first! I want to become comfortable exploring new software and machinery offered through MDes.
- Make something quirky every week! I used to toil over math homework to make time for creativity, and now my entire program revolves around it -- it's a privilege!

**Foresight:** Earning my PhD in Learning Sciences of Makerspaces for Adult Learners and either teaching at a university or moving into industry as a researcher!📚

**Research topics:** Adult Education, Curriculum Design, Educational Technologies, Currere (connection between subject and self)

**Curiosities:**
- Answering the question of the modern student: *when will I use this in the real world?*
- Exploring emerging technologies and digital media tools that could be integrated into classrooms
- Figuring out how students/learners can express their identity in their education
- Building learning environments that foster creativity while still meeting educational objectives
- Improving online documentation for self expression and knowledge-sharing

**Strengths:**
- Lists are my jam. I am a procedural person and like to zoom out and see the bigger picture of a project.
- I *love* documentation! Despite my math degree never truly requiring writing assignments, I enjoyed reflecting on my courses and thinking about abstract ways that my lectures connected to my passions in design.
- I'm a strong advocate of professional development tools/frameworks. As a Native American woman in STEM, having mentorship to formally express my passions helped me reach my goals -- and now I want to build those tools for others' self-actualization as well.

Alas, after preparing my initial instructions on Monday, I felt as though I had prompt-engineering-block (a modern parallel to writer's block, perhaps?) for half of the week. On Wednesday night, as a tradeoff for being sick of my laptop, I chose to brainstorm different topics I would add to my *knowledge sets* in Apple Notes. I came up with the following topics:

Knowledge Sets:

- Research abstracts
- Publication abstracts
- Former PhD goals (BSU) —> present (UCB)
- Personal philosophy 
- My mentorship/PhEd
- Faculty of interest; meeting notes with them
- possible phd programs to enter
- makerspace ideas
- Zine “About Author” bio
- TDF project reflections
- MDes Skills Inventory

Instructions:

- Act as a faculty research advisor and provide a critical lens on identifying potential research/PhD topics based on Marissa Maldonado’s background and interests. 
- Take into consideration the expectations for depth, relevance, and precision required of research questions in PhD dissertations. 
- Be strict and provide feedback with feasible action plans. 

Variables:

- NAME
- RESEARCH TOPIC
- FIELD OF STUDY

As the procrastination dread set in after lecture on Thursday evening, I felt a jolt of inpsiration promptly at 10 PM on a Thursday night and have been working at it since then. 

# Reflections

📌 I can't blame my overanalysis for the procrastination, but I will say that with my mathematics background being in set theory and data visualization, I think I was frozen by the sheer amount of possibilities for different combinations of information. 

# Speculations

📌 At this point I am just ideating on what I'm capable of for the remainder of the class! I am curious in what ways I can utilize more digital outputs (such as the OLED displays) to communicate input/output of the user through kinesthetic emerging technology pieces.
