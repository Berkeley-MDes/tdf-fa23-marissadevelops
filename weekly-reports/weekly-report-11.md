# Weekly Report 10: 11/3 - 11/9

## Project 3 Reflection

Throughout most of project 3, I was trying to manage potential burnout, so I definitely didn't get to put as much time and iteration into my chatbot as I would've liked. I was still very happy with the output though based on what I fed it, and I actually use my chatbot every couple days to help me with random academic tasks. For example, I asked it to write my MDSA Academic Officer biography for the application (although I ended up declining the opportunity anyways). I also used it to help draft an introduction of my research background for an outreach email to an education journal I want to publish for! Of course, I replace/reword around 50% of the content, but it helps me identify key points that I'd like to expand on. 

I really thought I was doing something when I edited my Project 3 video, but every time we get to presentation day in class, I never feel like I encapsulated my experience well enough. I think I capture the *narrative* of my projects, but I always get peer feedback asking for more technical details. Considering I upload it to my personal YouTube channel, I constantly consider my audience, which is often people who are not in academia or tech. My tone often leads more towards my philosophy around learning within the project instead of explicit details for how I built it.

## Transitioning from Project 3 to Project 4

Every TDF project I've done has been me being thrown into the deep end of the pool -- which I am fine with and I love the learning curve -- but I am often preoccupied with trying to wrap my mind around the curriculum and learning outcomes, letalone a working prototype. 

⭐ For project 4, I really want to take the time to refine my documentation process, start my video/PDF early, and to improve the level of technical detail I provide. ⭐

During our Monday lecture on 11/6, as we began an overview of our final TDF project, I thought about the array of skills I've gained throughout the course.

- Project 1: fabrication, laser cutting, computational design
- Project 2: more fabrication + hand tools, microcontrollers, cloud-based publishing
- Project 3: LLM prompt engineering, information hierarchies, user testing

So, in connecting all of these together alongside my interests in educational research, I want to integrate these skills into a project I am doing for a seperate class. I created an interactive diagramming lesson for students to take inventory of various environments in their academic/career/personal life and to find intersections that could lead to pragmatic action items through interdiscplinary exploration.

In short: a semi-structured interview process with a student who engaged in the diagramming activity. Provided below is a diagram from a peer who I conducted an interview with.

But how could I challenge this initially analog project to exist on a digital scale? Since I already have an intervie prototocol for my education research project, I would be interested in training a new ZeroWidth LLM model on this data, alongside some relevant educational theories/frameworks. 

Additionally, I want to challenge myself to use the ZeroWidth API in building a simple application that would guide a student through a reflective process on their transferrable skills, passions, and future goals.

A cool add-on would be utilizing their input and showing a data visualization using the OLED display available through out Photon kits.

That is what I have so far for ideating on Project 4. I really want to push myself and achieve axolotyl level this time.😎

# Reflections

📌 In the last 3 TDF projects, I had the realization that I have never had a formal technology design education before entering the MDes program, and I can feel that as I make my prototypes, edit my videos, and explain my process. I am trying the best I can though, and I am proud of myself for learning something new every week!

# Speculations

📌 After meeting our previous visiting speaker, Monit Bhoite, I am curious of the ways in which creative exploration of technologies could be integrated into a STEM-ED workshop for college students. It challenges the standard rigid expectations of robotics and Monit offered a unique twist on the idea of functionality and aesthetic.
