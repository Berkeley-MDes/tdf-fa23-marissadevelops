# Weekly Report 14: 11/30 - 12/7

## Project Checkin

### TH, November 30, 2023; Jeff (in-person)

I updated Jeff on my inner-turmoil with overcoming my coding anxiety, but he was super supportive and helped me to take manageable steps in the right direction. Some things I updated him on included:

- progress with my local server
- troubleshooting API issues
- p5.js steps

Some advice he gave included:

- using Postman to test my API
- Contacting Peter, from ZeroWidth, for assistance with connecting to the API (I don't know why I was nervous to reach out)
- told me to start simple with a basic line and textbox using the [p5.js reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/), then slowly move up to more a intricate design
