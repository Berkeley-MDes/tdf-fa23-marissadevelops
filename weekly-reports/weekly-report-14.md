# Weekly Report 14: 11/30 - 12/7

## Project Checkin

### TH, November 30, 2023; Jeff (in-person)

I updated Jeff on my inner-turmoil with overcoming my coding anxiety, but he was super supportive and helped me to take manageable steps in the right direction. Some things I updated him on included:

- progress with my local server
- troubleshooting API issues
- p5.js steps

Some advice he gave included:

- using Postman to test my API
- Contacting Peter, from ZeroWidth, for assistance with connecting to the API (I don't know why I was nervous to reach out)
- told me to start simple with a basic line and textbox using the [p5.js reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/), then slowly move up to more a intricate design

## Progress

Update: I went into overdrive for completing this project by the deadline and did not track explicit dates for my progress, but I will still share what I collected below...

I learned a lot about the structure of post requests, API testing, and API syntax. There was a lot of troubleshooting in getting my javascript to call my API, so I used Postman (an online API platform) to test my post requests.

Eventually I had to pivot and use an iframe to call the chatbot from ZeroWidth instead due to learning curves, technical difficulties, and time constraints. It looked beautiful though!

Although I was new to working with p5.js, I knew it was important to maintain functionality for the diagram. What if the user wanted to add, remove, or drag textboxes around within the diagram? So I added the features and designed a consistent styling format using CSS. In addition, I learned how to call CSS classes within javascript functions (very cool)!

# Reflections

📌 Overall, I was very happy with how my front-end web development skills improved over the course of the semester, as well as my prompt-engineering abilities. It was a learning curve, but I achieved what I could and look forward to utilizing these experiences towards my next emerging technology project!

# Speculations

📌 In terms of impacting human experiences: Educational technology tools already exist in classrooms, but curriculums need to know how to integrate them. Digital media products are becoming increasingly accessible for creative learning environments, and these technologies will prepare learners for a new form of self-expression.
