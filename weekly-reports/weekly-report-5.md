# Weekly Report 5: 9/22 - 9/28

## Curriculum Analysis 📚

I haven't tinkered with the Photon2 and breadboard since the introductory workshop last week, but I did apply our previous photon2 workshop lesson to an educational framework that I'm studying. A quick overview:

The term *professional vision* was developed by Charles Goodwin in the 1990s, and it expanded on the guidance that teacher's provide students based on their own high-level insights. Professional vision is broken into 3 acts:

1. Coding: identifying and categorizing features within a given context
2. Highlighting: foregrounding a latent feature in the problem environment
3. Graphical representation: visual symbolization and elaboration representing solution to problem

Here is my application to our TDF lecture:

Where coding expects students to apply categorization to a given domain of scrutiny (in this instance, the microcontroller kit), we had to explore the various hardware assigned in the tool kit and identify the relevant components for building a basic circuit.

The teachers highlighted the desired profile, or mapping, of the circuit in a guided tutorial with the class. The actions conducted by the teachers were then mirrored by the students, contributing to our trust in their professional vision of the project. Where there may have been various details we hadn't considered, their attention to detail led to conditional relevance. For example, the pins of our microcontroller should never touch a metal laptop because it could fry the hardware, but as a novice, we may not have been aware of the hazard. Instead, we were guided and had various restrictions highlighted to us.

Note: This is (clearly) photoshopped because I did not grab a photo during lecture (unbeknownst to me, it would end up being a perfect example of *professional vision*)

Additionally, if there was low visibility for certain angles of the physical hardware on the screen, the teacher used a digital template of the circuit board to highlight the key components instead. As you can see below, the rows/columns with voltage are bolded in green -- a structural process that isn't able to be visualized with physical hardware, and instead acts as conceptual learning assistance. This is a perfect example of graphical representation within a learning framework.

This exercise contributed to students' academic maturity by means of guided practice, not only through the professional vision of faculty, but also through the tangible exploration of a given technical project.

## Monday Lecture Reflection 📝

The Project 2 brainstorming session was a great experience! I enjoyed getting to collaborate with my peers. I loved looking around the room at  the whiteboards and seeing all of the different approaches to mapping out ideas. I read some literature on gamifying diagram exercises the other week and it has been so awesome to see applications in class. Visual thinking is such a valuable skill in the ideation process, and it was interesting to see other people blend perspectives to reach various abstract frameworks. 

Additionally, the guest lecturer, Adrian Freed, was so talented! His statement, "I design in a circle" had both a literal and metaphorical underpinning thoughout the presentation. Projects centered around designing for humans will always provide a feedback loop for the designer. In connection to our upcoming project on Digital Ecosysyems, explorin the use of electronic textiles was a tangible example of what our group projects will be capable of. Adrian also brought up the use of ethnography in building digital ecosystems -- which was a phenomenal conceptual connection for me, considering I did multiple ethnographic research projects in undergrad -- and understanding the need to understand not only the person we are designing for, but the environment we are designing in.

For example, we had to building block activity. We were told to structure the blocks based on a unique word we were assigned; my group tried to visualize *flexibility* with rigid wooden blocks. It feels like an oxymoron, but I immediately thought of applying the concept of parabolic curves
to the assignment (ie, creating a curve using straight lines). Here is our final product below: 

![parabolic curve blocks](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-marissadevelops/assets/143042473/365955e1-9ecf-4611-92f6-f783796817a7)

Once we were done, Adrian pointed out the value in **taking inventory of materials in a design system**. Although we had a flat surface to work with for the project, if the table had been at an angle, many of the designs would have fallen. This is also relevant to the "real world", in that we cannot always control the foundation in which we build on.

Although I do not have former experiences with e-textiles, I absolutely loved Adrian's anecdotes on the communities built around these sorts of projects. He mentioned something about an "e-textile camp" that people would attend, and instead of competing against eachother, the information was shared and open-access in order to make progress faster. Adrian brought this huge, 4-inch binder with a bunch of zipper pouches inside it. They held all of these little prototypes he'd made using conductive fabric and thread. I couldn't really wrap my mind around it at a technical level, but what *really mattered to me* was the binder. It was such a great representation of analog portfolios. And how sometimes, we don't meed a fancy website to share the cool things we made. Sometimes it just takes having a community of other passionate people to move ideas forward. I want to carry around a 4-inch binder full of all my ideas now.⭐️

## Proposed idea for Project 2 📊

I proposed that we serve graduate students struggling with stress and overwhelm by utilizing physical sensors that track heart rate (linked to anxiety) and tracking data from hours studied and attending lecture each day; determining correlation; then providing mental health guidance based on results. 

I felt a bit ~ spicy ~ proposing this topic amidst all of the stress I have witnessed with our first wave of project deadlines in the MDes program. But that is what interdiscplinary study calls for: identifying the problem that nobody else will name in order to begin solving it. 

# Reflections

📌 After looking around at the whiteboards and speaking with my peers after class, it was so funny to realize how connected all of the assigned topics actually were. *Empathy* could lead to *healthcare* and *education* could lead to *community* and so forth. Even if somebody got assigned a topic they weren't familiar with, the iterative process of ideation provides interdisciplinary results regardless.

# Speculations

📌 I really enjoyed proposing my Digital Ecosystems project through the Google Form and was proud of myself for exploring ways in which to use emerging technologies to empathize with my community!💌
