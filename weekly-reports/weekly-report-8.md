# Weekly Report 5: 10/13 - 10/19

## The Remaining Timeline

### October 12, 2023, Thursday

- Update: the 3d print was not successful, major L, but alas, will try again with different infill settings.
- Will be reprinting only the larger gear box for the sake of time constraints and knowing that we’ll be testing the larger motor anyways.
- Additionally... should’ve added a skirt to the model. Sorry to the first Prusa printer we used.

### October 13, 2023, Saturday

- 2nd iteration of 3d printed gear box for the MG92B Micro Servo
- had an issue with the skirt of the print impacting the gear teeth, used a dremel to sand it down (too tedious, learned my lesson)
- overall, worked enough for low fidelity testing

### October 14, 2023, Sunday

- Solder the Featherwing Doubler (Marissa)
- Divta redesigned the CAD file for linear servo actuator, then I reprinted it. Happy to say I feel much more comfortable using the Prusa printers now. :-)
Initial testing with IR sensor to get it working, using some input (Marissa)

### October 16, 2023, Monday
3d print was a success!
Gear is 1.5” (full rotation covers 4.71 [3.14 x 1.5]); pinhead in 4.5”,
Need to attach servo to 3d printed mechanism
Attaching 3d print + photon to laser-cut wire feeder
Ensuring photons can talk to eachother

### October 17, 2023, Tuesday

Since I was the team member who focused on documentation the most, I woke up at about 6 AM to start editing the video in preparation for the final project due date on Thursday. I used Canva; it has decent UI and let me collaborate with my team easily. 

Mechanical:

- Recut the plywood board with new measurements/alignment
- Attach wire feeder, linear servo actuator to plywood board with screws
- Glue metal plate to cabinet hinge, drill cabinet hinge to board with screws
- Attach metal tube to wire feeder output, add 3D printed holder
- Assemble linear servo actuator 3D print 

Electronics:

Connect power from source to Wire feeder, Servo motor and IR Sensor
Robust wiring/soldering of circuit

Coding:
Get photons talking to each other
Map input from IR sensor to output of Servo
When do we want to turn the feeder “on” and “off”? When there is/isn’t an IR sensor reading? 

Testing:
Angle of plate (pitch), Servo strength to lift/lower plate


Order of Action:
Glue metal plate to cabinet hinge- Done
Get photons talking to each other- Done
Map input from IR sensor to output of Servo- Done but need to refine
Assemble linear servo actuator 3D print- Done, needs to be attached to base

# Reflections

📌 In the last week, I learned how to use a dremel, impact drill, hand saw, and 3d printer. I am super happy with how many skills I got to build while toiling away in the makerspace as our deadline got closer. I feel so much more comfortable in the woodshop now, as well, and have a better intuition around which tools can get the job done fastest based on project specs.

# Speculations
