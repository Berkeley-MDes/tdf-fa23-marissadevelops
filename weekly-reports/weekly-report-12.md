# Weekly Report 12: 11/10 - 11/16

## Project 4 Proposal: Diagrammatic goal-setting AI for adult learners 

### Summary

I will be creating  a digital application of an analog goal setting activity I  built in a design-based research course; I would integrate my interview protocol into the zerowidth LLM, develop a simple interface to have students track their ideas, and then creating a visual output to represent the conversations they have with a guided AI.

### Research Plan

1. Train LLM on goal-setting activity curriculum and interview protocol using ZeroWidth
2. Utilize ZeroWidth API to output specific user data to a web application
3. Determine UX structure for interactive diagramming templates
Visualize select user data as a diagram using p5.js

### Current Work

This project mainly pulls from my project experience with the ZeroWidth AI.

Preliminary experience includes:
- prompt engineering
- information hierarchies
- user testing
- UX + curriculum design

### Motivation

With my background being in curriculum design and an increasing passion for educational technologies, I plan to create a digital application of an educational self-reflection exercise utilizing AI and data visualization techniques.

I will be recapping on my initial checkins from last-last-Thursday, where I met remotely with Sudhu and in-person with Jeff.

### Timeline

WEEK 1: 11/9 - 11/15

- Set up development environment ✅
  - Setup local server using node.js
- Begin writing instructions and knowledge sets for ZeroWidth LLM ✅
  - Still in process
- Research best visualization method ✅
  - Using p5.js as my visualization method

WEEK 2: 11/16 - 11/22 

- Create digital environment diagram in Figma ✅

- Proof of concept: AI prototype
- Train LLM on interview protocol
- UI + UX mockup for diagram functionality
- Implement drag + drop functionality

WEEK 3: 11/23 - 11/29 

- Complete implementation of diagrammatic data visualization model
- User testing and design iteration
- ZeroWith API integration testing
- Begin video presentation + PDF presentation

Optional (if time permits [doubtful, Socrates]): Collecting some quantitative data and visualizing it using an OLED screen by publishing data to the photon IDE.

## Checkins

### TH, November 9, 2023: Sudhu (remote)

Sudhu mainly encouraged me to focus on defining parameters for the final outcome in terms of action items. Additionally, he told me to start with the hardest thing first. For me, that will be the visualization component connecting the user input from the chatbot to an interactive digital interface. 

### TH, November 9, 2023: Jeff (in-person)

Since I had already met with Sudhu, I was better prepared to speak with Jeff. He recommended that I view my project through the lens of educational technology, but to still prioritize materials, hardware, and software that we've already covered. 

A unique tool he recommended was utilizing p5.js to support an interactive diagramming component with drag+drop functionality.

# Reflections

📌 I have always wanted to make projects like this and have been too anxious to start, but now I've committed to this TDF project. I want to become comfortable with hosting on a local server, working in the command line, and exploring p5.js capabilities.

# Speculations

📌 The integration of STEM curriculums into interactive p5.js applications could be an interesting approach to lesson planning within educational technology!
