I am unsure the best way to document my conversations with my bot, but here is the welcome message I integrated and my opening question:

<img width="558" alt="Asking AI bot what Marissa Maldonado believes in" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-marissadevelops/assets/143042473/475a44d3-26d0-4aca-b43c-288272288fdd">

<details><summary>AI response:</summary>

Based on the information provided, Marissa Maldando's believes in:

Learning Beyond the Classroom: Marissa sees opportunities for learning beyond traditional, lecture-based education. She is focused on exploring real-world applications of the knowledge gained, thereby also addressing the question, "When will I use this in the real world?"

Incorporation of Identity in Education: Marissa wishes to discover how learners can express their individual identities through their education. This belief comes from her personal experiences and identity as a Native American woman in STEM.

Design & Creativity: Marissa believes that design and creativity are central to the learning process. Despite her solid background in mathematics, she is passionate about integrating design principles into the learning process and wishes to build learning environments that foster creativity while meeting set educational objectives.

Professional Development: Marissa advocates for professional development tools and frameworks. Stemming from her own experiences, she recognises the impact of mentorship and wishes to create tools that can facilitate others' self-actualization.

Documentation & Reflection: She values the practice of documenting her learning journey and believes in the power of reflecting on one's courses and experiences and thinking about abstract ways in which lectures can connect to individual passions in design.

Integrating Emerging Technologies: She is curious about the different emerging technologies and digital media tools that could be integrated into classrooms and the impact they could have on teaching and learning experiences.

Adult Education: Her research is focused on the learning sciences of makerspaces for adult learners, highlighting her belief in lifelong learning and the potential for adults to continue learning and evolving in their knowledge and skills.

I responded: How could Marissa integrate her interests of Makerspaces and Adult Education into a PhD topic in the Learning Sciences?

<details><summary>AI response:</summary>
Marissa's interests in Makerspaces, Adult Education, and Learning Sciences present a unique combination conducive to a rich and multifaceted PhD research topic. Here are a few possibilities:

Curriculum Design for Makerspaces in Adult Education: Marissa could conduct research aiming to create a comprehensive, context-sensitive curriculum specifically tailored for adult learners in makerspaces. This would involve investigating the unique challenges and opportunities of teaching adults, understanding the pedagogical methods that work best within makerspaces, and understanding how to balance between creative freedom and structured learning.

Impact of Makerspaces on Professional Development & Career Transition in Adults: Considering her focus on Professional Development tools/frameworks, Marissa might explore how involvement in makerspaces can support adults in their career development or transitions, particularly in the context of emerging technologies and fields.

Makerspaces as a Tool for Identity Expression in Adult Learning: Her focus on identity expression via education could translate into a study on how participation in makerspaces can help adults express and form their identities, particularly for those from underserved and minority backgrounds.

The Role of Emerging Technologies in Adult Education within Makerspaces: Marissa could explore the effect of integrating emerging technologies (such as Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and AI) in makerspaces and ascertain their potential to transform the learning experiences of adult learners.

Analysis of Online Documentation and Knowledge-Sharing in Makerspaces: Investigating the role of digital media in documenting and sharing knowledge in makerspace-based adult education could tie in well with her interest in improving online documentation for self expression and knowledge sharing.

In choosing a topic from these or deriving her unique question, Marissa should consider the potential for original contributions, scope for long-term study, and alignment with her career aspirations, be it academia or industry research.

I responded: I am Marissa; I have been thinking about ways that gesture recognition during semi-structured interviews with adult learners could contribute to my research interests. I would be recording and analyzing their gestures during hands-on course projects exploring emerging technologies. I want to explore the learning happening "beneath the surface".

<details><summary>AI response:</summary>
That sounds like a highly innovative and integrative approach to your research, Marissa! Here are a couple of ways to shape your PhD topic around gesture recognition in the context of adult learning in makerspaces:

Gestures as Indicators of Learning Progress: You could propose a study that treats adult learners' gestures during their work with emerging technologies as non-verbal cues of their learning progression. How does a learner's manipulation of tools change as their understanding deepens? What might their hand movements and interactions with technology say about their comprehension and skills?

Correlation Between Gestures and Cognitive Processes: Explore the potential correlation between specific gestures and cognitive processes (e.g., problem-solving, understanding complex concepts, creativity). You could investigate if particular kinds of gestures or patterns correlate with breakthrough moments of learning or understanding in adults.

Impact of Gesture Recognition on Curriculum Design: Another possible research angle could be studying how gesture recognition insights can influence the design of educational programs for adults. This could impact everything from the layout and setup of physical resources in a makerspace to the timing and delivery of teaching interventions.

Gesture-Based Feedback Systems: Leveraging gesture recognition technologies, you could explore the development of real-time feedback systems in a learning environment. Does immediate feedback based on gesture analysis change the way adults learn or interact with the technology?

Remember, a key aspect of a PhD is contributing original knowledge to your field. Studying gestures in this context might help reveal elements of adult learning that are overlooked in traditional learning assessments and could contribute to more holistic and nuanced understandings of adult education.

I have around half a dozen conversations similar to this and have tweaked details throughout it. Over the weekend, I had added the linked knowledge sets that included my research and publication background. The bot now takes around 20-30 seconds to process my request, but shares relevant details with me on different directions I could take my research. 

Next, I will be feeding it the MDes curriculum and courses I took this semester. Since I create educational content online for my YouTube channel (@marissadevelops) and personal website, it is about time in the semester that I began my reflections and personal checkins. Last night I journaled and came up with the following topics I'd like to cover through long-form videos:

	⁃	Mid-semester reflection video
	⁃	MDes Curriculum analysis
	⁃	Skills Inventory for Fall 2023
	⁃	Reflecting on former research interests and professional involvement

I want to use my chatbot to help me outline notes for a YouTube video and try to follow it while recording. I'm curious if it will take away my humanity or not (lol).
