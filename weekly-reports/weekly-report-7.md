# Weekly Report 5: 10/6 - 10/12

## Thursday Lecture Reflection 10/5 📚

With a majority of the class time being dedicated to group work, I appreciated that we were expected to begin our shared Figma file amongst the group and explore its documentation capabilities. Although we had already began a shared Google Docs file, it was nice to easily transfer over all of the comments we had related to intial ideation. TJ had checked in on us during the process and I showed him all of the various categories I included on our file, including: expected project learning outcomes, our submitted project specs, materials inventory, ideation meetings with TDF faculty, and our experimentation process across software and hardware. He told me I would be a great project manager -- I agree. It brings me great joy to organize an overwhelming amount of information and summarize it into concise categories.

## Pre-Lecture DiWire Testing 10/10

Although we want to find a much more minimal wire feeder, our first accessible testing point was the DiWire machine in the Jacob's Hall Makerspace. It is about 12" x 6" x 6", rather sturdy, and can support 1/16" - 1/8" wire. Our first test (from last weeks report) showed that it can bend very thick 1/8" wire, but there were limitations on manipulating the wire to curve since only sharp angles were possible. Consider the interface of the DiWire software (reference following image): the functionality is only through the use of arrow keys on a keyboard, providing a very limited scope of movement for the wire, in addition to the speed the wire is fed.

For our second test, we obtained 1/16" wire to feed through the DiWire machine. We knew it was thin enough to be manipulated to a sharp angle, but wanted to explore malleability for curves. Using a single chisel (x: 0, y:0, z: 45) we provided a "wedge" in which to test how well the wire would follow a guide.

It worked well and the result was what we expected. This guaranteed that, given the proper power of our next wire feeder, alongside a movable "arm" or "wedge", we could manipulate wire into a curved form.

Next we tested the 1/16" wire using two chisels ((x: 0, y:0, z: 45), (x:45, y:90, z: 45)) to see if we could guide the curve at an angle in order to produce a spiral.

Success! It was a smooth process and provided better insight into the quality of our wire, as well as contributing to the project scope of creating an interactive, kinetic-sensory wire sculpting installation.


## Post-Lecture Monday Night Work Session 10/10

In trying to manage all 3 of our schedules to find a working session, we ended on 7-9 PM after lectures, as well as working mid-afternoon on Wednesdays, and updating documentation on weekends. So after lecture on Monday, we all headed to the Jacob's Hall Makerspace to collectively test out our first
