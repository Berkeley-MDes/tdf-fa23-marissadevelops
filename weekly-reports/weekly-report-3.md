# Weekly Report 3: 9/8 - 9/14

I entered this week with a more positive attitude surrounding the use of Rhino + Grasshopper. I still struggled with file compatibility for my software (mainly for the 2d laser cut files), but I did explore the 3d printed design a lot more. My qualm with the 3d printed prototypes is how bulky it seems; I still love the minimal design of laser cutting and the ability to disassemble.

I feel that the designs in my head definitely don't match my current skillset in Rhino + Grasshopper. I wanted to customize the design to make it a lot cuter 🌸 but knew that I should focus on functionality before I get ahead of myself.

I got settled in at a coffee shop and sketched out my first two prototypes, reflecting on my experience using my phone stand at home in the past week.

The first prototype was the general template provided at the beginning of the semester. I used this design as an opportunity to familiarize myself with the software and machinery. As mentioned in last week's report, I had issues with dimensions and the fitting of various components.

I challenged myself to modify the design a bit more for the second prototype. This allowed for orientation change, but the structure was still a bit wobbly. I used it around my apartment for a week and realized 1) volume buttons get pressed in horizontal orientation 2) bit too bulky for my space, I want to minimize the size as much as possible while still having stability.

Back to the drawing board! I really wanted to focus on minimalism in my design. Although I didn't feel it necessary to add many aesthetic alterations based on my limited software skills, I chose to round the edges for a less harsh shape. Provided below is the initial dimensions overlayed with the minimized model I altered in Rhino:

I laser cut a 3rd prototype that had a base of about half the size and reduced the length of the upwards strips, but maintained the initial wedging build of the laser cut design. 

I wanted to fix ____, so I decided to add a little star to it for my final test cut!
