# Weekly Report 3: 9/8 - 9/14

I entered this week with a more positive attitude surrounding the use of Rhino + Grasshopper. I still struggled with file compatibility for my software (mainly for the 2d laser cut files), but I did explore the 3d printed design a lot more. My qualm with the 3d printed prototypes is how bulky it seems; I still love the minimal design of laser cutting and the ability to disassemble.

I feel that the designs in my head definitely don't match my current skillset in Rhino + Grasshopper. I wanted to customize the design to make it a lot cuter 🌸 but knew that I should focus on functionality before I get ahead of myself.

I got settled in at a coffee shop and sketched out my first two prototypes, reflecting on my experience using my phone stand at home in the past week.

The first prototype was the general template provided at the beginning of the semester. I used this design as an opportunity to familiarize myself with the software and machinery. As mentioned in last week's report, I had issues with dimensions and the fitting of various components.

I challenged myself to modify the design a bit more for the second prototype. This allowed for orientation change, but the structure was still a bit wobbly. I used it around my apartment for a week and realized 1) volume buttons get pressed in horizontal orientation 2) bit too bulky for my space, I want to minimize the size as much as possible while still having stability.

Back to the drawing board! I really wanted to focus on minimalism in my design. Although I didn't feel it necessary to add many aesthetic alterations based on my limited software skills, I chose to round the edges for a less harsh shape. Provided below is the initial dimensions overlayed with the minimized model I altered in Rhino:

I laser cut a 3rd prototype that had a base of about half the size and reduced the length of the upwards strips, but maintained the initial wedging build of the laser cut design.

My first attempt at the re-design wasn't proportioned correctly, so I tried one more time and got a working final draft!😄

I'm super happy with how minimal it is and look forward to exploring more computational design without the technical difficulties.

# Reflections

📌 Seeing Cody present his work within the scope of Rhino + Grasshopper helped me feel motivated to explore the software more! My mental block still remains on the necessity of computational design for such small objects, though, compared to the intensity of modeling entire buildings. 

# Speculations

📌 With regard to impacting the human experience: considering my background is in education, my main takeaway from the project was reflecting on ways that skills such as laser cutting and general prototyping could be taught to people with less exposure to emerging technology. How can I package up the idea to be more accessible to broader audiences?
