# Weekly Report 12: 11/10 - 11/16

## Project Checkin

### F, November 17, 2023; Jeff (remote)

My meeting with Jeff motivated me a lot, something he told me really stuck with me when I expressed my stress in avoiding coding while having so much math experience: “The magic is in the math that you already know." When it comes down to it, computer science is applied mathematics. If I can get over this learning curve in implementation + setup that has always stopped me from exploring creative coding environments, then I can make this project happen!

He also helped me develop some action items for the following week, including:

- diagram digital environment carefully and share; what does a user flow look like?✅
- p5.js integration ✅
- set up dev environment for local host; use Shm's resources ✅
- begin writing instructions sets on ZeroWidth

### M, November 20, 2023; Jeff (in-person)

After working on my local hosting Sunday night, I addressed some issues I was having with integrating p5.js. I tried to emulate Shm's model in my own folder (ie changing naming conventions), but couldn't target the right folders. Jeff advised that I just copy the entire folder and make sure the npm express is downloaded for the new folder -- and I had it working within 30 minutes! Woohoo!

## Progress

### Sunday, November 19

I downloaded node.js in the mac terminal, it was relatively easy for the most part, although I often forget git commands immediately after I use them lol. With practice it will come to me more naturally!

Although I could run the sample website that Shm provided, I started to struggle once I began trying to integrate the p5.js library and example set on my local host. I started digging into the original js file that was successfully showing on my localhost (and then emulate that in my new folder), but no success. Appears I will have to use some javascript to fully utilize node.js 'express' functionality.

I am continuing my Figma diagramming; tonight I laid out the structure for my ZeroWidth LLM instructions, knowledge sets, and data chunks.

Next, I need to diagram a user flow for structuring my digital interface, but I think I need to ensure I have code to even initiate that procedure in the first place. This week is all about testing ZeroWidth structuring and integrating their API into a digital interface. I will slowly add knowledge to my ZeroWidth AI, but I need to start with the hardest things first; I'm not too worried about prompt engineering.

### Monday, November 20

Today I completed diagrams for the digital environment, user flow and rough wireframes for my web application!

Additionally, after setting up my localhost, I was able to integrate p5.js into my html and js files. It's not pretty (yet), but it's something!

# Reflections

📌 It feels incredibly awkward to explore web development from scratch after functioning in WordPress (and only writing html/CSS) for so long. It will be an important learning curve for me to conquer though!

# Speculations
