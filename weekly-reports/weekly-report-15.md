# Weekly Report 15: 12/7 - 12/14

I will keep this report relatively short since the final project was completed last week!

## Showcase Prep

Prepping my TDF project for the showcase was relatively easy, because I mainly just had my laptop. During presentations, I did feel that I lacked some sort of tangible element to my project and tried to reflect on ways I could've gone beyond a 2d, digital environment. In my hopeful ideation at the beginning of the project, I had made the goal of using an OLED display to aggrate the number of items a user had made on their diagram and relfecting that as a quantitative visualization. Did not happen due to time constraints, but it could've been cool!

## Showcase Feedback

I had a lot of fun presenting my project. A majority of the conversations focused on the state of college students in higher education (ie, disconnect/discontent for their coursework). From there, I was able to preface the introduction of emerging technologies and AI into educational environments to improve students' connection to their identity and coursework.

If I were to extend the duration of this project, I would enact more user testing throughout the development process, as well as refine the aesthetic and interface of the web application as a whole. Furthermore, bringing this product to market would require thoughtful iteration for the sake of productive interaction with students.

# Reflections

📌 I can't believe I made it to the end of the semester! I learned so much and am so grateful for the dedication of TDF faculty and our lovely GSR in helping to make the  course what it was. 

# Speculations

📌 Curriculums that integrate emerging technologies will have a new standard of development for student learning outcomes, and educational technology research will need to largely accelerate their scope of focus in order to keep up with modern tools in classroom environments.
