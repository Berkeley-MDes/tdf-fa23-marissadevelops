# Weekly Report 2: 9/1 - 9/7

After a frantic episode of creation last week, my former mindset started to come back (ie, minimalism). Although I prototyped 3 variations of the phone stand, I still strongly dislike the use of physical materials in testing designs. It bothers me -- the idea of being responsible for a physical object. It is why I have always been a 2-d, digital type of gal. 

This motivated me to explore Rhino + Grasshopper more so that I could test variations of my designs without having to use more material; another benefit of computational design!

I don't want to get burnt out on prototyping (we're only in week 3), so I decided to take a break over the weekend and slowly transition back into tutorials during the school week. I followed along with TJ's *computational design worked example* on YouTube and also tried to find real-world applications of the tutorial in my daily life.

Recall that computational design is aimed to Observe ➡️ Measure ➡️ Model ➡️ Evaluate ➡️ Fabricate ➡️ Test ↩️

I downloaded the *Simple Cellphone Stand Model* file.

TJ's de-construction of the model made me realize that modeling is just breaking an object down to its simplest components. Just like in mathematics, we are working with a given set of dimensions (1d, 2d, 3d (let's not think about 4d)), geometric shapes that are defined by given points with a domain/range, as well as a function that combines the given values (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). 

When working with the video, around the time that we began taking the difference of the two spheres at a given z-axis, this precisely reminded me of *symmetric difference* in set theory. It looks like this:

In comparison to the phone stand in Rhino, we can see the applications of *union* and *difference* below:

I followed along for the remainder of the tutorial and appreciated TJ taking the time to navigate the grasshopper file in more depth!

<details><summary>Finding computational design in everyday objects</summary>
While taking a break from fabricating/testing products, I wanted to look around at everyday objects in my life and to understand ways that I could construct them through computational design.

- I recently bought a foldable bluetooth keyboard to connect to my phone (for writing + research on the go!!!). The structure of the design came with a phone ledge. I considered how certain phones may not be supported for that width/height/depth, and what variations could be made to imrpove it.  Although I likely will not dismantle and resdesign the ledge of this object, I challenged myself to break down relevant parameters that could be applied to Rhino + Grasshopper.
- Provided below is the physical artifact and my diagram of relevant parameters for computational design:

After drafting this in Procreate on my iPad, I realized that this foldable keyboard is actually a phone stand as well (in its own niche way), so I suppose I have been seeking out relevant inspirations within this project!😄

# Reflections

📌 Sometimes taking a break from different aspects of a project allows for inspiration in other areas. I took a step back from fabrication and explored Grasshopper + Rhino a bit more!

📌 My math degree has left me with a plethora of theoretical concepts that I can see in real-world applications. It has been convenient in identifying the variables of an object for computational design.

# Speculations

📌 I have regained faith in my ability to build my own computational design in Rhino + Grasshopper since watching TJ's guided tutorial and making personal connections to my pure mathematics background. I am curious in what ways I can lean on my proof-writing skills in breaking down more complex computational design patterns. 

📌 After signing up for ShapeDiver and exploring the public forum, it motivated me to search for topological shapes. I think it could be a great hands-on tool for mathematics classrooms and enable students to alter the paramaters of geometric shapes!
