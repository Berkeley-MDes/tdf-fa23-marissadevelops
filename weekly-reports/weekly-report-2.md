# Weekly Report 2 ⭐

After a frantic episode of creation last week, my former mindset started to come back (ie, minimalism). Although I prototyped 3 variations of the phone stand, I still strongly dislike the use of physical materials in testing designs. It bothers me -- the idea of being responsible for a physical object. It is why I have always been a 2-d, digital type of gal. 

This motivated me to explore Rhino + Grasshopper more so that I could test variations of my designs without having to use more material; another benefit of computational design!

I don't want to get burnt out on prototyping (we're only in week 3), so I decided to take a break over the weekend and slowly transition back into tutorials during the school week. I followed along with TJ's *computational design worked example* on YouTube and also tried to find real-world applications of the tutorial in my daily life.

Recall that computational design is aimed to Observe ➡️ Measure ➡️ Model ➡️ Evaluate ➡️ Fabricate ➡️ Test ↩️

I downloaded the *Simple Cellphone Stand Model* file.

TJ's de-construction of the model made me realize that modeling is just breaking an object down to its simplest components. Just like in mathematics, we are working with a given set of dimensions (1d, 2d, 3d (let's not think about 4d)), geometric shapes that are defined by given points with a domain/range, as well as a function that combines the given values (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). 

When working with the video, around the time that we began taking the difference of the two spheres at a given z-axis, this precisely reminded me of *symmetric difference* in set theory. It looks like this:

<details><summary>Finding computational design in everyday objects</summary>
While taking a break from fabricating/testing products, I wanted to look around at everyday objects in my life and to understand ways that I could construct them through computational design.

- I recently bought a foldable bluetooth keyboard to connect to my phone (for writing + research on the go!!!). The structure of the design came with a phone ledge. I considered how certain phones may not be supported for that width/height/depth, and what variations could be made to imrpove it.  Although I likely will not dismantle and resdesign the ledge of this object, I challenged myself to break down how this would look in Rhino + Grasshopper.
