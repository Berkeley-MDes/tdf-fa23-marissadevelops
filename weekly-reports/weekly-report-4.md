# Weekly Report 4: 9/15 - 9/21

This week we wrapped up our Computational Design projects and were introduced to the Photon2 microcontroller. I will be documenting my process setting up the Photon2.

## Setting up the Photon 2

I initially had an issue with finding an adapter for my macbook, but my peers helped me out and informed me that we were provided a USB-C adapter in our kit (shoutout to TDF for planning ahead!).

Setting up the device, finding my MAC address, and configuring wifi was relatively easy once I had the hardware components organized.

I came to campus to complete the Berkeley-IoT wifi setup and tried out the Hello World prompt! I flashed the code to my Photon2 and continued to the next step. 

I moved on to the hardware example projects suggested from the TDF wiki page.

Projects I tried on Particle Web IDE:

- Blinking an LED: I copied the code and altered the delay settings in the loop, which altered the speed of the blinking LED.
- Set up a function call for blinking an LED: toggled it on + off from Particle Console functions tab.
- Stopped at the breadboard section of the project

I am super excited to explore this project and our Proton2 kits more! I've always wanted to learn about Arduinos and microcontrollers, so this will be a nice introduction.

## Computational Design 1 Feedback

I enjoyed the first TDF project a lot, but I do have some regrets. I wish I would've overcome the Grasshopper compatibility issues on my laptop for my project. Although I explored Grasshopper templates given in class, I never made my own from scratch and feel that I missed out on a really unique interaction with computational design software. 

When receiving feedback from peers after my video presentation, I kept getting comments about wanting to see my Grasshopper files more, but all I had was Rhino 7 files!🫥 Although we are already sailing into the next project, I want to explore grasshopper in my freetime and gain back the knowledge I missed out on in month 1 of TDF. I learned that I should reach out for help from faculty earlier in the projects instead of later, it would help the learning curve a lot.

My peers did enjoy how personalized my presentation was, which I appreciated! I viewed Project 1 from the lens of education and reflecting on my experience being introduced to a new software and prototyping. I utilized this in my Project Brief PDF and connected it to a learning framework I am studying in one of my elective courses. I am trying to feed two birds with one scone!🐥🍞🐥

# Reflections

📌 I think that my anxiety surrounding prototyping really impacted my engagement with Project 1. I ended up with a phone stand I love and use daily, but I didn't really utilize the Grasshopper component as much as I could've. This has motivated me to be more open to new learning experiences throughout the remainder of TDF and to ask for help when needed.

📌 Tinkering with the Photon2 today has left me looking forward to the next project! I haven't worked with code in a while, but there are a lot of resources online and I enjoy the hands-on component of the project. 

# Speculations

📌 This is such a low-impact speculation, but I've always wanted to design my own cat-laser-pointer device using a microcontroller. I'm very curious to look through the toolkit more and see what options are available to me in exploring smaller projects.
